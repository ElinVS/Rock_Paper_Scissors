<h1>How to play the game</h1>

<section>
    <article class="rules">
    A classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying, “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On “shoot,” each player holds out their fist for rock, flat hand for paper, or their index and middle finger for scissors. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Rock crushes scissors 
    <br> 
    Scissors cut paper 
    <br> 
    Paper covers rock 
    <br> 
    See who wins each round!
